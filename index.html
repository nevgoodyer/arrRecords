    <h1>&quot;Arrays of Records&quot; in 4 languages.</h1>
    <h2>Visual Basic (VB), JavaScript (JS), Python (Py) and Pascal (Pas) all have data structures for &quot;arrays of records&quot;. 
        This repository uses &quot;student&quot; records with string, integer and float data types as the example.</h2>

    <br />
    After an overview of the syntax for each language, students will use Visual Basic and possibly 
    JavaScript to build a Pizza ordering app, consolidating concepts of:&nbsp;
    <br />
    <ul>
        <li>adding additional fields and the corresponding screen elements.</li>
        <li>updating data and screen element dictionaries to keep track of additions.</li>
        <li>ergonomics, consisting of &quot;appropriate&quot; screen elements and &quot;tab order&quot;.<ul>
            <li>text boxes</li>
            <li>radio buttons</li>
            <li>check boxes</li>
            <li>a data picker</li>
            <li>dropdown boxes for times</li>
        </ul>
        </li>
        <li>constantly updating version numbers in:<ul>
            <li>form header (VB &amp; html)</li>
            <li>page title (html)</li>
            <li>links below</li>
        </ul>
        </li>
        <li>validation, so that the app is &quot;unbreakable&quot; in 2 ways:
            <ul>
                <li>on submit.</li>
                <li>on exit from each text box.</li>
            </ul>
            The 1.05 version is easily broken with an invalid date or character instead of a number.</li>
        <li>the creation of a case insensitive search, possibly including non &quot;utf-8&quot; characters.</li>
        <li>constantly dealing with VS &quot;Errors&quot;, &quot;Warnings&quot; and &quot;Messages&quot;, so that code is high quality.</li>
        <li>handling &quot;infinite loop&quot; (runtime) and &quot;logic&quot; errors.</li>
        <li>using the student database as a template for the development of a similar &quot;Pizza&quot; ordering database</li>
